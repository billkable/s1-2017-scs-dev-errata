== Introduction
- Cloud Native applications provide solutions to modern business
problems, but at a cost.

- Cloud Native solutions may compose of complex distributed systems.
Such systems cannot be designed in same manner as legacy orchestrated
monoliths.

== Background

=== The Original 12 Factor Application Methodology
- https://12factor.net/

=== The Original 12 Factor Application Methodology
- Outlines architectural principles and patterns for modern application
    * Clean contract between applications and the platform they run on
    * Focus on scalability, continuous delivery, portability and cloud readiness
- Authored by Heroku

[NOTE.speaker]
--
A methodology for building software-as-a-service apps that:

- Use declarative formats for setup automation, to minimize
time and cost for new developers joining the project;

- Have a clean contract with the underlying operating system,
offering maximum portability between execution environments;

- Are suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms,
obviating the need for servers and systems administration;

- Minimize divergence between development and production,
enabling continuous deployment for maximum agility;

- And can scale up without significant changes to tooling,
architecture, or development practices.

- Most of these principles are built in to the Cloud Foundry platform
--

=== Beyond 12 Factors
- The original Heroku guidelines are dated, and optimized for their platform
- Additional 3 principles identified and documented by Pivotal
- Original 12 are enhanced through field experience and mining
 of best practices
- Defined order of precedence

=== Beyond 12 Factors - Reference

== The 15 Factors
=== OneCodebaseOneApplication
- An application has a single codebase
    * Multiple codebases = distributed system (not an app)
- Tracked in version control
    * Git, Subversion, Mercurial, etc.

- Multiple deployments
    * Development, testing, staging, production, etc.
    * Don't hardcode anything that varies with deployment

[NOTE.speaker]
--
- On journey from Monolithic Architectures towards Microservices
One Codebase may be assigned to Multiple Apps in a Multi-Module
build.  In this case One Codebase - One Team more or less applies
- Important not to span Codebase between Teams.
--

=== ApiFirst
==== ApiFirst - Public contracts, External APIs
- Build services to be consumed strictly through external API
- Consumer depend _only_ on the external API.
- Consumer knows _nothing_ of a service's internal implementation

==== ApiFirst - 1st Class Citizens
- Test for forward/backward compatibility
- Publish APIs for public consumption
- Consider versioning API's for forward and backward compatibility

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Issues arise between teams if not implementing formal APIs, causing integration
pain.

Classic anti-pattern is avoiding API, and dipping to backend data-stores.
This results in hard to detect defects, and causes integration nightmares.
--

=== DependencyManagement
1. Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
    * Dependencies declared in a manifest
        ** Maven POM, Gemfile, etc.
    * Use a dependency isolation tool (e.g. bundle exec) to ensure that dependencies don’t leak in from the system
    * The dependency management approach is applied uniformly to development and production
    * Results in running the application after a deterministic build command

=== DesignBuildReleaseRun
==== DesignBuildReleaseRun
- Strictly separate build and run stages
    * Build stage: converts codebase into build (version)
        ** Including managed dependencies
    * Release stage: build + config = release
    * Run: Runs app in execution environment

==== DesignBuildReleaseRun - Cloud Foundry
- In Cloud Foundry, these stages are clearly separated with cf push
    * Developer executes a build
    * Staging combines the build and config to create a droplet
    * Droplets are copied to a container and run

=== ConfigurationCredentialsCode
==== ConfigurationCredentialsCode
- External Configuration
    * Config != internal immutable application configuration
- Store config in the environment
    * Anything that varies by deployment should not be included in the code
    * Additionally consider separating config (e.g. database URL or feature flag) from credentials

==== ConfigurationCredentialsCode - Environment
- Environment may be:
    * Environment Variables
    * External configuration server recommended
        ** Versioning and Audit Trail
        ** Centralized Config Store

[NOTE.speaker]
--
There is misconception that "Storing Configuration in the Environment" means
leveraging environment variables.
The problem with use of environment variables is that runtimes such as Java
that source configuration from Environment Variables _must_ be restarted
for configuration changes to take effect.  This is not a scalable solution
when factoring in dynamic config changes such as thread management, logging
levels, or feature toggles.
A Centralized Config Store may be considered another backing resource to
Cloud Native applications.
--

=== Logs
- App logs are streams of aggregated, time-ordered events
- Apps are not concerned with log management
    * Just write to stdout or stderr
    * Do not write to logfiles
- Separate log managers handle management, debugging, analytics, monitoring, etc.
    * Papertrail, Splunk …

=== Disposability
- Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
- Processes should be disposable, they're stateless!
- Should be quick to start
    * Enhances scalability and fault tolerance
    * Apps in containers start very quickly
- Should exit gracefully / finish current requests
    * Apps should be architected to handle unexpected terminations

[NOTE.speaker]
--
The first way of thinking is that processes should exit gracefully by finishing
the thing that they are currently working on.
If you have submitted a request for a web page, you want that request to finish
before the back end process dies.

But sometimes this can't be helped, such as when the plug is pulled.  For these
situations we like our processes to be idempotent, meaning  that you can safely re-process
something without fear of duplicate processing.
Reentrant means a half-processed job could re-enter the processing where it left off
(rough definition).  Think of how Hadoop MR processes can die and be restarted with
no data loss or data duplication.

Crash-only software is, well, designed to crash.  Actually, designed so that whatever
the process is doing, when the plug is pulled, the data is safe (idempotent,
reentrant, etc..  Like pulling the battery out of your laptop, most Oss now start
up faster after a crash than they do after normal shutdown.
See http://lwn.net/Articles/191059/

Robust processes may also leverage frameworks such as Netflix OSS Hystrix and Ribbon
to handle graceful failure and recovery without requiring terminations of processes.
--

=== BackingServices
- Treat backing services as attached resources:
    * Service are consumed by the application
        ** Database, message queues, SMTP servers
    * May be locally managed or third-party managed
    * Connected to via URL / configuration
    * Swappable (change MySQL to an in-memory database)
        ** The app and backing services are loosely coupled

[NOTE.speaker]
--
- Backing resources need not only be restricted to middleware
- Backing resources may be other services
--

=== EnvironmentParity
==== EnvironmentParity
- Keep development, staging and production as similar as possible
    * This enables high quality, continuous delivery
    * Use common tools and a clear separation of concerns
        ** Application vs. operating environment/platform
        ** Dependency management
        ** Build, compile, release
        ** Code, configuration, credentials

==== EnvironmentParity
- Use the same services in development and production
- Minimize surprises in production

[NOTE.speaker]
--
More than ever, developers can use the same services in development and production.
The use case for “light” developer tools is diminishing.
--

=== AdminProcesses
==== AdminProcesses - Don't Run Them
- Do not run admin processes unless absolutely necessary
    * Handle migrations via forward/backward compatibility in services code.

==== AdminProcesses - If You Must
- Admin processes / management tasks run as one-off processes
    * Applies to developer admin or maintenance tasks (i.e. migration, clean-up).
    * Run admin processes on the platform
        ** Use the same environment, tools, language as application processes
        ** Admin code ships with the application code to avoid synchronization issues

=== PortBinding
- Export an application’s services via port binding
    * Every app instance is accessed via a URI and port number
    * One app can become another app's service

[NOTE.speaker]

Here is some useful info on this topic:

--

=== StatelessProcesses
==== StatelessProcesses - Stateless
- Processes should not store internal state
- Any necessary state is externalized as a backing service

==== StatelessProcesses - Shared Nothing
- Data needing to be shared should be persisted
  * “Sticky sessions” violate 12-factor methodology
  * Consider using GemFire cache or Redis key-value store
- Use local memory or the local filesystem only as a single transaction “scratchpad”
  * Use storage as a service if needed (Amazon S3, MongoDB)

=== Concurrency
- Achieve concurrency by scaling out horizontally
- Scale by adding more app instances
- But individual processes are free to multithread

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Concurrency refers to the ability to have many concurrent users on many different app
instances with no problems.
--

=== Telemetry
==== Telemetry
- Manual monitoring solutions do not scale for Cloud Native applications
- No direct access to container endpoints
- Think of your app as a "Space Probe"
    * Remote, aggregate monitoring solutions are required

==== Telemetry - Solutions
- APM (App Performance Monitoring)
- Domain specific monitoring/telemetry
- Health and Aggregated Systems Logs

[NOTE.speaker]
--
APM, Health and Systems logs are typically non-functional concerns critical
to monitor for an application's health
Domain specific monitoring is business specific, which may provide way to monitor
operation of key business functions provided by the application (i.e. for example,
in Ordering system, the number of orders processed successfully, ordered failed/retried,
orders that failed that require remediation (fallout)
--

=== AuthenticationAuthorization
==== AuthenticationAuthorization
- Cloud Native apps require security for safety
- Security should _never_ be an afterthought in application design.

==== Authentication and Authorization - Solutions
- OAuth2
- OpenID Connect
- SSO standards (such as SAML)
